-- changing fonts and font families
    => if no fonts are choosen then each browser chooses its own default font
        - to see the font-> browser->inspect->computed

    => font-family requires the name of a font/ list of fonts, including an optional family of fonts.
        - font-family : georgia, serif;
            here, georgia is the font name and serif the family of fonts
        again,
          font-family : "Gill Sans" , sans-serif; here, "Gill Sans" is the list of fonts
            - this means that use "Gill Sans" font but if u cant find it then use any sans serif font
        
    => two popular fonts are 'serif' and 'sans-serif'. see the difference from google.

    => now there's a problem with choosing a font, as not every machine has the same set of fonts. So different
       fonts can be displayed in different machines

    => website -> www.cssfontstack.com -> it helps us to find the overlapped fonts in all machines

    => but this problem can be solved if we link the font file with each html document.
    
    => font-family : option1, option2, option3,..... last_default_option;
        - if option1 not found then option2 and keep doing that until last_default_option(a fall back family)
        - last_default_option : sans-serif/ serif /monospace (any of the fonts from these family of fonts)
    
    => font is inherited.


-- Font sizes:

    => a lot of different units in font-sizes.

    => pixels (px) is the default unit for font-sizes.

    => inherited element. 


-- Font-weight:
    => boldness or the weight of the text.

    => we can go from normal text to bold text and vice versa.

    => normal -> 400 and bold -> 700


-- Font-style:
    => make text italisized or not italisized.

    => font-style:intalic;


-- Text-alignment: text-align
    => aligns the text inside of the eliment where it resides.
    
    => it's inherited.

    => direction:rtl; (right to left) and (left to right: ltr)


-- letter-spacing:

    => spacing between each letter

    => default is 0 px

    => we can also give negative values, which will shrink the text up.


-- word-spacing:
    => similar to letter spacing but in case of words.


-- line-height:
    => space between two lines.

    => line-height:2.5; it will multiply the current line-height with 2.5


-- text shadow:
    => see the syntaxes from mdn

    => text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px pink | offset-x offset-y blur-radius color;

    => offset-x / offset=y specifies how many pixels should the shadow defer from the original text

    => this offset value can be negative too.

    => multiple shadows can be added by a comma.
