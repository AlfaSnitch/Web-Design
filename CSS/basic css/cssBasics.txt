different ways to include css in html
    1. inline style:
        => we directly embed our style information in individual html elements. example,
            <p style="color:red"> this is a red paragph </p>
        => this changes the color of this p tag only, emphasis on the only.
        => problem with this is, if we want to change all the p tags along with all the attributes
            it becomes very tedious

    2. internal css:
        => we embed css using style tag. example,
            <style>
                p {
                    color: red;
                    font-size: 30px;
                }
            </style>
        => this style element is used in the head tag
        => problem with this is, if we have a bunch of pages and all the p tags of all the pages needs 
            to be changed but it wont be in the same effect.
        
    3. External css:
        => write css in a differnt file and then link to it in the html document.
        => we use a link element in head.
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css/>
        => now create an app.css file and in that give the css 
            p{
                color: magenta;
            }


********************************************* Anatomy of css ***********************************************

=> we use selectors to choose what elements we are styling

        #hamburger-button {
            width: 10px;
            border-radius:20px;
            background: rgb(250,250,250)
            position: relative
        }
=> here #hamburger-button is the selector.
=> inside the curly braces we define the 'properties', ie how are we styling the elements.

=> now the properties have some rules that they follow,
            property name : value;
        like, 
            width : 20px;


***** more about selectors ******

=> select all paragph element in the document,  it is an 'element selector'
    p {
        width : 100px;
    }
