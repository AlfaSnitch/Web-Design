Color property
    => to change the color of the text
    => color : red;

Background color
    => changes the Background color of an element
    => background-color : green;
    => emphasis on the element, if blocked then the whole width but if anchor(a) tag then just the text itself
    => color will be how much space the element takes up

Color Values:
    => named color -- color : red;
    => hexadecimal -- color: #ffffff;
    => RGB colors  -- color: rgb(25,29,30);
                      color: rgba(25,29,0.8);
    => hsl color   -- color : hsl(30,100%,50%);
                      color : hsla(30,100%,50%,0.2);
    => HWB color   -- color : hwb(1.5078rad 20% 10% / 0.7);

    => css recognizes 140+ predefined named colors.
    
    => RGB colors 
        - allows for 16 million colors, specified by 3 numbers
        - every color is a synthesis of red, green & blue
        - format , rgb(red channel, green channel, blue channel) and each of the channel values from 0-255
        - rgb color picker can be used in vs Code
    
    => hexadecimal colors
        - short for rgb color
        - 6 numbers , 2 for each channels and a '#' symbol at front
        - 255 -> ff so rgb(255,255,0) -> #ffff00
        - for specific colors we can reduce the six colors to 3, like #ffffff -> #fff, so when each pair is the same 
        then we can do that
    
    => transparency, colors and opacity
        - rgba(10,10,10,0.5), here 'a' is Alpha channel(transparency) which takes from 0-1
        - its default value is 0

CSS inheritance:
    => some css properties, like color are inherited from parent element if no value is specified.
    => other properties are not inherited and instead have a default initial value 
    example,
        <p> this is a css inheritance <em> color scheme </em>

        p {
            color: olive;
        }

        the <em> inherits the color from its parent, <p> tag

    => 'border' attribute is not inherited, it will only apply to the element i am using it on.
        - although we can use inheritance in border by setting its value to inheritance
            border : inherit
                -- this takes the value from its parent
